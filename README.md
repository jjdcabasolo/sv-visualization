Implementation of the structural variant visualization using D3.js and jQuery.

This is a Bachelor of Science Affiliate Scholar International Rice Research Institute Project in fulfillment of the requirements for the University of the Philippines Los Baños BS Computer Science Course, CMSC 190 (Special Problem).

# Abstract
Structural variants discovery started to attract attention from genomics scientists after several researchers unravel the effects of these variants to an organism[1]. For people to understand such knowledge in an efficient and simplified manner, a visualization application for structural variants was proposed and implemented. This application can generate a simple data visualization for structural variants on a web browser, given the correct set of data. This can help people interested in structural variants in their study and research. A set of tools were also provided to increase the level of usability of the viewer.

# How to use
 - Clone the repository first.
 - Inside the folder, use `npm install`
 - On the same directory, run `node server.js`
 - On your browser (Google Chrome recommended), go to `localhost:8000`
